TO RUN:
	make 
	make test
	make clean

"make" runs the compiler and generates an executable. "make test" runs tests. "make clean" cleans teh output of previous test.

Before re-testing the code, do not forget to run "make clean".


 

Note: Passing make test does not guarantee the correctness of your program. Testing thoroughly is your responsibility.
